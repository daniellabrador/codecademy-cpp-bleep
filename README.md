# **Bleep**

The Bleep program accepts a string of text and bleeps out all instances of the word . This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in using classes and objects using C++.

## Project Prompt

> “You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.” - Ray Bradbury

Congratulations on your new job at the Department of Re-education! You have been tasked with building an algorithm that can bleep out any words deemed unsavory by the powers that be.

Write a bleep.cpp program that “bleeps” any word that’s passed in. You’ll test this out with `"broccoli"`, which has been recently banned by the Department.

Turn some text like `"I'm rolling up my broccoli"` into `"I'm rolling up my ********"`.

Make sure to use pass-by-reference in your functions so you can modify the incoming text!

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download the `hpp` and `cpp` files. Save them in a single directory/folder.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

### Command Line / Bash

```git
g++ bleep.cpp program.cpp -o bleep
./bleep
```

### Command Prompt

```git
g++ bleep.cpp program.cpp -o bleep
ooya.bleep
```
